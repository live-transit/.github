# LiveTransit
**Real-time Transit Tracking**

LiveTransit is a powerful public transit tracking platform, using artificial intelligence on information from previous journeys as well as recognition from cameras to tell you exactly where your vehicle is and when it will arrive.

It consists of a React front-end website, interacting with the open-source LiveDB database contributed to by users. Meanwhile, a back-end program interacts with the various public transport APIs and runs machine learning programs to determine locations and contribute these to the LiveDB database.
